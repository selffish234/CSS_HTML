target = "_blank" title ="html specification">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard markup
language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage 
and render them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web 
page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

<p style="margin-top:45px;">HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images
and other objects, such as interactive forms, may be embedded into the rendered 
page. It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural 
semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other 
items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.</p>
